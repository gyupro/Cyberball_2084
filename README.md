# Cyberball_2084

This project is about how to make a simple game with ChatGPT.

This is a basic cyberball game crafted by ChatGPT.

I had this idea: How well could ChatGPT create a simple game?

Here's the result, which I'm excited to share with you.

The blue paddle moves up and down on its own at a consistent speed, while you control the red paddle to hit the ball.
